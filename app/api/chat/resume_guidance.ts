export const RESUME_GUIDANCE = `Use bullet points. A resume is not a cover letter. List down your impact as bullet points in a concise manner.

Use Google's XYZ formula. Write your bullet points according to this format: "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]." Example: Instead of saying "Built the checkout pages of the e-commerce portal in a team", say "Led development of an optimized checkout flow which boasts a conversion rate of 5%, resulting in an ARR of $10M by working with in a cross-functional team of 4 and doing extensive A/B testing."

Quantify impact and achievements. Numbers help with justifying impact. Possible ways to quantify achievements - number of users, queries per second, cost/time saved, revenue generated (make sure it is not sensitive information), number of people involved in the project, number of files/lines of code refactored, reduction in support tickets filed, etc.

Give examples. Giving concrete examples of past work is a way of demonstrating the scope and complexity of the work.

Demonstrate leadership, scope, and complexity. You should try to convey the complexity and scope of the projects. This is especially important if you are going for senior roles and have fewer actual years of experience than the standard for the role. Hiring managers will be more convinced you are up for the job if you have prior experience at your current company.

Don't include unimportant things done at work Such as organizing offsites or social events for your team`
